Building AOS procdeure:
0. Prepare environment
  The AOS is building under docker.

1. Build docker
  cd AOS/EC_VOB/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/utils/
  source build_env_init
  cd ../docker/
  make build

  NOTE: if docker image is built successfully, it will have docker image tagged accton/build-aos5810_54x:9.1.

2. Enter build environment, under AOS/EC_VOB/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/docker
  ./run_docker.sh

3. Init build environment variable
  root@3f26c0a36c31:/home/aos5810_54x/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/utils# source build_env_init

4.a build all with sdk,
  put sdk related files into the build environment,
  then under docker root@3f26c0a36c31:/home/aos5810_54x/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/

  ./make_all
  or execute the scripts from number 1 - 8

4.b build all without sdk
  put prebuilt binary tarball into /home/aos5810_54x/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/,
  then under docker root@3f26c0a36c31:/home/aos5810_54x/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/

  export WITHOUT_SDK_FLAG=1
  ./make_all
  or execute the scripts from number 1 - 8

5. generate image
  ./make_runtime
  ./make_onie_installer

  In docker, the final image file is located at folder, /home/aos5810_54x/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/runtime/
  or outside docker, EC_VOB/project_build_environment/aos5810_54x/runtime/
