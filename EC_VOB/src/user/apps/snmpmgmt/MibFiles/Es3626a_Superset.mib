             object with an HCPerfCurrentCount syntax starts from zero
             and is increased when associated events occur, until the

             the gauge is stored in the first 15 minute history

             available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding
             error message shall be returned to indicate that this
             instance does not exist.

             This count represents a non-negative integer, which
             may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed 2^64-1

             adjustment as a result of entering or exiting unavailable
             time), then the object's value also decreases.

             Note that this TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,
             because the 'always increasing' and 'counter wrap'
             semantics associated with the Counter64 base type are not
             preserved.  It is possible that management applications
             which rely solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to
             determine object semantics will mistakenly operate upon

             This textual convention represents a limited and short-

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation: 'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'. That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

            For a detailed description of this object, please refer to
            SNMPv2-TC MIB."

            interleaved and the fast channels are enabled or disabled
            according to the value of their ifOperStatus.

            Defined values are:

            noChannel(1)          -- no channels exist
            fastOnly(2)           -- only the fast channel exists

            The status column has six defined values:

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 - 'notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

                      the managed device (see NOTE below);

                      exists in the agent, but is missing information
                      necessary in order to be available for use by the
                      managed device;

                      - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                      station wishing to create a new instance of a
                      conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                      to active, making it available for use by the managed
                      device;

                      wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                      an existing conceptual row.

                 Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
                 be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
                 three values will be returned in response to a management
                 protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
                 'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
                 has only three states:  it is either available for use by
                 the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
                 it is not available for use by the managed device, though
                 the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
                 status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
                 available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
                 make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
                 information (the state column has value 'notReady').

                 The status column has six defined values:

                      available for use by the managed device;

                      exists in the agent, but is missing information
                      necessary in order to be available for use by the
                      managed device;

                      - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                      station wishing to create a new instance of a
                      conceptual row and to have its status automatically set

                      wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                      an existing conceptual row.

                 Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
                 be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
                 three values will be returned in response to a management

                 it is not available for use by the managed device, though
                 the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
                 status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
                 available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
                 make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient

                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 - 'notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

            "The status of this conceptual row entry. This object isused to manage the
            creation and deletion of conceptual rows.

            The status column has six defined values:

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 - 'notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

        DESCRIPTION
            "The status of this conceptual row entry. This object isused to manage the
            creation and deletion of conceptual rows.

            The status column has six defined values:

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 - 'notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

            For a detailed description of this object, please refer to

            "The status of this conceptual row entry. This object isused to manage the
            creation and deletion of conceptual rows.

            The status column has six defined values:

                 - 'active', which indicates that the conceptual row is
                 available for use by the managed device;

                 - 'notInService', which indicates that the conceptual
                 row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by
                 the managed device (see NOTE below);

                 - 'notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row
                 exists in the agent, but is missing information
                 necessary in order to be available for use by the
                 managed device;

                 - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row and to have its status automatically set
                 to active, making it available for use by the managed
                 device;

                 - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a management
                 station wishing to create a new instance of a
                 conceptual row (but not make it available for use by
                 the managed device); and,

                 - 'destroy', which is supplied by a management station
                 wishing to delete all of the instances associated with
                 an existing conceptual row.

            Whereas five of the six values (all except 'notReady') may
            be specified in a management protocol set operation, only
            three values will be returned in response to a management
            protocol retrieval operation:  'notReady', 'notInService' or
            'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row
            has only three states:  it is either available for use by
            the managed device (the status column has value 'active');
            it is not available for use by the managed device, though
            the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the
            status column has value 'notInService'); or, it is not
            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to
            make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient
            information (the state column has value 'notReady').

            available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to

                and deletion.

                Setting cHsrpGrpRowStatus to 'active' causes the router to
                communicate using HSRP.

                The value of cHsrpGrpRowStatus may be set to 'destroy' at any
                time.

                Entries may not be created via SNMP without explicitly setting
                cHsrpGrpRowStatus to either 'createAndGo' or 'createAndWait'.

                Entries can be created and modified via the management
                protocol or by the device's local management interface.

                A management application wishing to create an entry should
                choose the ifIndex of the interface which is to be added
                as part of an HSRP group. Also, a cHsrpGrpNumber should
                be chosen. A group number is unique only amongst the groups
                on a particular interface. The value of the group number
                appears in packets which are transmitted and received on a
                LAN segment to which the router is connected. The application
                must select the group number as explained in the description
                for cHsrpGrpNumber.

                If the row is not active, and a local management interface
                command modifies that row, the row may transition to active
                state.

                A row which is not in active state will timeout after a
                configurable period (five minutes by default). This timeout
                period can be changed by setting cHsrpConfigTimeout."

                cHsrpExtIfTrackedPriority. This reduces the likelihood
                of a router with a failed key interface becoming the
                active router.

                Setting cHsrpExtIfTrackedRowStatus to active starts
                the tracking of cHsrpExtIfTracked by the HSRP group.
                The value of cHsrpExtIfTrackedRowStatus may be set

                Entries can be created and modified via the management

                If the row is not active, and a local management interface
